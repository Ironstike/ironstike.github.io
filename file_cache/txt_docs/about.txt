I'm a high schooler who loves not break computers, at least not on the hardware side and write html for fun.  I like installing Linux on stuff and jailbreaking stuff.<br>
<h3>My favorite games are</h3> 
<ul>
<li>Terraria</li> 
<li>Deltarune (the greatest game every made)</li> 
<li>Spiderheck</li> 
<li>Wii sports resort</li> 
<li>Team Fortress 2 (because I'm cultured)</li> 
<li>Totally Accurate Battlegrounds.</li>
</ul>
I do cross country because I love torturing myself and I can't, for the life of me, beat the second slowest guy on my team (I'm the slowest). 
I also have ADHD 👍
