Background → #121212 (the dark foundation, the void everything lives on)

Surface (cards, section boxes, containers) → #1E1E1E (slightly lighter so you can tell things apart)

Primary → #90CAF9 (your main accent: buttons, links, highlights, active states)

On Primary (text/icons on primary) → #0D47A1 or just plain black at 80% opacity (contrast matters here)

Secondary → #26A69A (secondary accents: chips, secondary buttons, supporting icons)

On Secondary → #000000 with ~80% opacity (so teal text/icons don’t vanish)

Error → #CF6679 (Google’s standard dark theme error pink-red, keep it consistent)

On Error → #000000 or near-black text for readability

Text / On Surface → #E0E0E0 (general body text, so it’s not blinding pure white)

On Background → same as on-surface, since background/surface tones are siblings
